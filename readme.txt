Dog Project

The project is to develop a machine learning model to determine the breed of the dog from the image provided. Over 6000 images were provided for training the model. Different model architectures were explored. A model from scratch and another model using transfer learning were developed. The model using transfer learning was performing much faster to train and had better accuracy.

The project is part of Udacity project and the image data being really large, it is not included as part of the submission.

The data for the project is stored in the server in the location "/data/dog_images/*".

The images for the human faces are stored in the folder "/data/l
